# üöÄ Rachio Local
**Rachio Local** Plugin for Home Assistant is a lightweight integration that enables seamless control and monitoring of Rachio irrigation systems through the Rachio API. By leveraging secure, outgoing API calls, the plugin allows Home Assistant users to retrieve real-time device status, manage watering schedules, control irrigation zones, and receive updates about their Rachio sprinkler system. Unlike traditional integrations that require complex webhook setups, this plugin simplifies connectivity by making direct, authenticated API requests, ensuring a straightforward and secure method of interfacing with Rachio's cloud services without exposing your home network to inbound connections.

## üîç About this Plugin
 **Rachio Local** removes the need to open your home assistant to public network for incoming traffic. Rachio allows 1700 calls a day to API and I have done my best to prevent exhausting them
 Let me break down the API calls under different scenarios:

**Normal Operations (No Active Watering)**
```
Base polling rate: Every 5 minutes
Daily calls = (24 hours √ó 60 minutes) √∑ 5 minutes = 288 base calls
```
**During Active Watering**
```
Polling increases to every 30 seconds while any zone or schedule is running
Example: For a 2-hour watering schedule
Additional calls = (2 hours √ó 60 minutes √ó 2 calls per minute) = 240 calls during that period
```
**Typical Day Example**
```
Base calls: 288
If you run 4 schedules per day:
Each schedule might run for ~2 hours
(4 schedules √ó 2 hours √ó 120 calls/hour) = ~960 calls during active watering
The rest of the day uses the 5-minute interval
```
**Estimated Total**
```
Normal day with 4 schedule runs: ~800-1000 API calls
Days with additional manual zone control: Add ~120 calls per hour of manual watering
This is significantly less than your current 1700 calls per day. The reduction comes from:
Using 5-minute intervals during inactive periods
Only using 30-second polling during active watering
```
**Efficient state management with pending operations**
```
Smart handling of schedule and zone transitions
The exact number will vary based on:
How many schedules run each day
Duration of each schedule
How often you manually control zones
Whether schedules overlap
```

## Features
- Zone Watering Control: Ability to start and stop individual irrigation zones through switches in Home Assistant.
- Device and Zone Status Sensors: Sensors that provide real-time status of the Rachio device and individual zones, including current watering state.
- Schedule Management: Switches to control and monitor irrigation schedules, allowing start and stop of predefined watering schedules.
- Last Watered Timestamp: Sensors that track and display the last time each zone was watered.
- Periodic Data Polling: Automatic data updates every 5 minutes to keep Home Assistant synchronized with the Rachio device status.
- **Dynamic Polling & Diagnostics:** Polling interval, device count, and API call usage are now exposed as Home Assistant sensors for full transparency and troubleshooting.
- **Robust State Sync:** Zone and schedule sensors always reflect the true running state, even for manual runs started from the Rachio app.
- **Multi-Device Support:** Improved logic for setups with multiple controllers and/or smart hose timers.
- **Enhanced Logging:** Debug logs for all state transitions and API responses for easier troubleshooting.

## üö® Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full changelog.

## Notes
My Home Assistant runs in Docker on a server. I don't use the supervised version, nor do I want to expose Home Assistant servers publicly. This is my personal choice, despite it requiring more manual management.
  
  <strong style="color:red;">I don‚Äôt know how it works with HAOS.</strong>

- I prioritize securing my network by blocking **phone home** calls from IoT devices, ensuring data privacy, or allowing thrid party webhooks.
- My Home Assistant setup includes an array of devices, with plans to expand further. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of what I manage:

    - üí° Hue
    - üè† Tuya
    - üìä Grafana for monitoring
    - üéû Emby for media
    - üö™ Door locks
    - üîí Cameras
    - üíª Local AI (on server)
    - üö¶ Pi Hole for ad-blocking
    - üñ• Full network & server monitoring, including GPU & storage
    - üåÄ Fans
    - And much more to come!
