# Complete Update Summary - Global Valve Configuration

## Overview
This document summarizes ALL changes made to the `rachio_local.update_program` service, transforming it from a complex per-run configuration to an intuitive global valve configuration system.

## Major Changes

### 1. Global Valve Selection (Biggest Change!)
**Before**: Valves specified per run (repetitive)
```yaml
run_1_valves: [switch.valve_1, switch.valve_2]
run_2_valves: [switch.valve_1, switch.valve_2]  # Same valves repeated!
```

**After**: Global valve selection (once!)
```yaml
valves: [switch.valve_1, switch.valve_2]  # Used by all runs
run_1_start_time: "06:00"
run_2_start_time: "18:00"
```

### 2. Time Format (User-Friendly)
**Before**: Seconds (confusing)
```yaml
run_1_valve_duration: 900  # How many minutes is this?
```

**After**: HH:MM:SS (clear!)
```yaml
total_duration: "00:15:00"  # 15 minutes - obvious!
```

### 3. Positional Valve Durations (Simpler)
**Before**: Dictionary with full entity IDs (complex)
```yaml
valve_durations:
  switch.hose_timers_front_yard: 600
  switch.hose_timers_back_yard: 900
```

**After**: Positional numbers (simple!)
```yaml
valve_duration_1: "00:10:00"  # First valve selected
valve_duration_2: "00:15:00"  # Second valve selected
```

### 4. Run Settings (New!)
**Added per-run control:**
- `run_X_run_concurrently`: Run valves simultaneously
- `run_X_cycle_and_soak`: Enable cycle and soak mode

**Example:**
```yaml
run_1_run_concurrently: true   # Both valves at once
run_1_cycle_and_soak: false

run_2_run_concurrently: false  # Sequential
run_2_cycle_and_soak: true     # Prevent runoff
```

### 5. Valve-Only Updates (Smart!)
**New capability**: Change valves without changing timing

```yaml
# Just update the valves - times stay the same!
valves: [switch.new_valve_1, switch.new_valve_2]
valve_duration_1: "00:12:00"
valve_duration_2: "00:08:00"
# Existing run times (6am, 6pm) preserved automatically
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Simple Morning Watering
```yaml
service: rachio_local.update_program
data:
  program_id: sensor.program_morning
  valves:
    - switch.front_lawn
    - switch.back_lawn
  total_duration: "00:20:00"  # 10 min each
  run_1_start_time: "06:00"
  days_of_week: [monday, wednesday, friday]
```

### Example 2: Custom Durations Per Valve
```yaml
service: rachio_local.update_program
data:
  program_id: sensor.program_garden
  valves:
    - switch.vegetables  # Valve 1
    - switch.flowers     # Valve 2
    - switch.lawn        # Valve 3
  valve_duration_1: "00:15:00"  # Vegetables need more
  valve_duration_2: "00:08:00"  # Flowers need less
  valve_duration_3: "00:12:00"  # Lawn medium
  run_1_start_time: "06:00"
  interval_days: 2
```

### Example 3: Multiple Runs with Different Settings
```yaml
service: rachio_local.update_program
data:
  program_id: sensor.program_summer
  valves:
    - switch.zone_1
    - switch.zone_2
  total_duration: "00:15:00"
  
  # Morning: Sequential with cycle and soak
  run_1_start_time: "05:30"
  run_1_cycle_and_soak: true
  
  # Evening: Concurrent quick water
  run_2_start_time: "19:00"
  run_2_run_concurrently: true
  
  days_of_week: [monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday]
```

### Example 4: Update Only Valves
```yaml
service: rachio_local.update_program
data:
  program_id: sensor.program_existing
  # Change valves - existing schedule preserved!
  valves:
    - switch.new_zone_1
    - switch.new_zone_2
  valve_duration_1: "00:10:00"
  valve_duration_2: "00:12:00"
  # Can also update run settings
  run_1_cycle_and_soak: true
```

## Migration Guide

### Old Configuration (v1.0)
```yaml
service: rachio_local.update_program
data:
  program_id: sensor.program_main
  run_1_start_time: "06:00"
  run_1_valves:
    - switch.valve_1
    - switch.valve_2
  run_1_valve_duration: 600  # seconds
  run_2_start_time: "18:00"
  run_2_valves:
    - switch.valve_1
    - switch.valve_2
  run_2_valve_duration: 600
  days_of_week: [monday, wednesday, friday]
```

### New Configuration (v2.0)
```yaml
service: rachio_local.update_program
data:
  program_id: sensor.program_main
  # Global valves
  valves:
    - switch.valve_1
    - switch.valve_2
  total_duration: "00:10:00"  # Clear time format
  # Just timing per run
  run_1_start_time: "06:00"
  run_2_start_time: "18:00"
  days_of_week: [monday, wednesday, friday]
```

**Benefits:**
- 50% less typing
- No valve repetition
- Clear time format
- More control options

## What's Preserved (Backwards Compatible)

The advanced `runs` field still works for power users:

```yaml
service: rachio_local.update_program
data:
  program_id: sensor.program_advanced
  runs:
    - start_time: "06:00"
      valves:
        - entity_id: switch.valve_1
          duration: 300
    - start_time: "18:00"
      valves:
        - entity_id: switch.valve_2
          duration: 600
```

- ✨ Positional durations (valve_duration_1, valve_duration_2)
- ✨ Run settings (concurrent, cycle & soak)
- ✨ Smart updates (valve-only changes)

### Design Principles Applied:
1. **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself (valves once)
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Simple for common, advanced still available
3. **Human-Readable** - Time format everyone understands
